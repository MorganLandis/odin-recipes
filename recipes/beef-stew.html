        <h3>Beef stew with golden Yukon potatoes.</h3>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 lb. of chuck beef (per 4 people)</li>
            <li>2 packets of Lipton onion soup mix</li>
            <li>A bag carrots</li>
            <li>A bag of potatotes
                (I typically prefer red or gold potatoes,
                 and a small 5 lb. bag will often be enough)</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place beef in a crock pot.</li>
            <li>Empty two packets of Lipton Onion soup mix on top of beef.</li>
            <li>Pour water into crock pot until beef is just covered.</li>
            <li>Cook on low for 4-6 hours, longer cook time will produce more tender beef.</li>
            <li>Chop washed carrots into 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch pieces, to preference.</li>
            <li>Chop washed potatoes into 1 1/2 inch chunks, average sized potatoes can be 
                "quartered" to roughly this size, or smaller potatoes can be placed in whole.
                Russet or Golden potatoes do not need to be peeled before being put in the pot.</li>
            <li>Peel and dice onion.</li>
            <li>Place vegetables into crock pot and cook for 4 more hours.</li>
            <li>If beef and vegetables cannot be pulled apart by a fork at this point and there is plenty
                 of broth in the pot, it can be continued to cok on low for another hour or 2.
                Ensure there is always atleast enough water to cover the beef while cooking. Vegetables will add to
                the water level as they cook.</li>
        </ol>
